And can you send us the content of the table COD_CONFGRPTYPDE for the configuration PTVBOX?


could you check and try if not ?
It is difficult to extract the statement from the source code because it is generated dynamically.
Anyway, we take into account the configurations defined in COD_GRPCONF and the configurations defined at the level of products.
Can you check if you have something in the column COD_ARTICLE.CCONFIG?
 

We would need your support for configuration of new OTT Box package on our webdist.
Only the serialId of the STB is requested on that product (and the INDGMTA of that Box is set to 1), and today we have following display : 
As you can see, for this offre and offreart, the requested equipment is at least 1 STB and 1 Smartcard.
 

Thank you for your notice, I will re-arrange the time and content for better time slots
